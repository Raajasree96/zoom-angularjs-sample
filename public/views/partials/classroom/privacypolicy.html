        <li>Information collected by us when you interact with our site, our mobile applications or when you open our email communications.

        <li>understand the effectiveness of our email communications.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>4. What will Wall Street English do with my personal information?</h3>
      <p>We and our group companies may use your personal information to process your online purchases, to inform you about products and services offered by us and by our Wall Street English franchise centres, to improve the products and services offered to you, for market research purposes, for marketing, statistical or analytical purposes, and otherwise to better meet the needs and preferences of our customers. We will not allow unrelated third parties to use your personal information for marketing without your consent.</p>
      <p>In particular, we may use your information to:</p>
      <ol>

        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>We also use personal information in aggregate form (so that no individual user is identified by name) to build marketing profiles, audit how our sites are used, and to help with the strategic development of our sites.</p>
      <p>Participation in surveys and discussion forums is entirely voluntary. You may unsubscribe from being contacted for these purposes at any time. Survey information will be used for market research with the aim of improving our services.</p>

Some Wall Street English sites also provide contact details you may use if you want to contact us by email, post or telephone in order to unsubscribe. In addition, some Wall Street English sites have a "My Account" page where you can choose whether to receive marketing communications from us.</p>
      <h3>6. How does Wall Street English keep my personal information safe?</h3>
      <p>We seek to protect the safety of all your personal information. In particular, provided your browser accepts Secure Sockets Layer encryption, we seek to protect your payment information against unauthorised access through a secure server. Where we use third parties to process personal information, we require them to ensure the safety of your information. We use appropriate security measures on our own systems, but the internet is not a secure medium and we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted via the internet.</p>
      <p>Any personal information that you voluntarily post on a public area of our site, such as a bulletin board or discussion forum, or an interactive area requiring registration and/or subscription, may be collected and used by others. Please be careful what personal information you disclose in this way. You understand that we cannot control the actions of other users.</p>
      <h3>7. Will Wall Street English share my personal information with anyone else?</h3>
      <p>We will never sell your personal information. We may disclose and share personal information with the third parties listed below. Because the internet is a global environment, you accept and agree that this will include the transfer of your personal information to other countries around the world.</p>
      <p>

        If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, take into account that these transfers will include countries outside of the European Economic Area which may not have the same data protection laws. Whenever we transfer personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area in the course of sharing information as set out above, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted by the applicable laws on data protection.<b>

          By using our site, or providing information to us in other formats, you consent to the collection and use of this information by us, as well as the international transfer of your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted by the applicable laws on data protection.</b>

      <p>We may share your personal information:</p>
      <ol>

        <li>with our group companies or any entity which acquires any part of our business;</li>
        <li>with our service providers (including, for example, credit reference agencies and payment processors, distributors/agents of our products, suppliers who develop or host our sites);</li>
